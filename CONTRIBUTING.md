## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rica.git
   cd rica
   ```

2. Copy environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update `.env` with your configuration

4. Start the development environment:

   start-rica-complete.bat all
   
   # Linux
   ./start-rica-complete.sh all
   ```

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use functional components over class components
- Implement proper error handling
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types
- Write meaningful variable and function names

### File Organization

- Keep components in `rica-ui/src/components/`
- Keep services in `rica-ui/src/services/`
- Keep styles with their components (ComponentName.css)
- Use index files for cleaner imports

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(ui): add health status indicator to topbar

Added a new component that displays the health status of all headless
servers in the topbar when viewing integrated services.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(docker): correct Ollama port mapping

Updated Ollama port from 11434 to 2024 to align with standardized
port mapping scheme (2020-2024).
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# UI tests
cd rica-ui
npm test

# API tests
cd rica-api
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new components and functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Ensure tests are meaningful and maintainable
- Aim for good code coverage

## Docker Guidelines

### Docker Compose Files

- Keep services modular
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Add health checks for all services
- Document port mappings
- Use named volumes for data persistence

### Dockerfile Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds
- Minimize layer count
- Use specific base image versions
- Don't run as root
- Clean up in the same layer
