## Using the Swarm Browser

### Creating a Profile

1. Click on the "Browser" icon in the left navigation sidebar
2. Click "Create New Profile" button
3. Fill in the profile details:
   - Name: A descriptive name for the profile
   - Platform: Choose between Windows, MacOS, or Linux
   - Browser Type: Select Chrome or Firefox
   - Proxy (optional): Enter proxy details if needed
4. Click "Create Profile" to save

### Managing Profiles

- **Launch Profile**: Click the "Launch" button next to a profile to open it
- **Edit Profile**: Click the "Edit" button to modify profile settings
- **Delete Profile**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a profile
- **Duplicate Profile**: Click the "Duplicate" button to create a copy of a profile

### Using the Browser

- **Navigation**: Enter URLs in the address bar and press Enter
- **Tabs**: Create new tabs with the "+" button, close tabs with the "Ã—" button
- **Social Accounts**: Click on social media icons in the footer to quickly access those platforms

## Production Best Practices

1. **Profile Management**:
   - Limit the number of active profiles to avoid performance issues
   - Use descriptive names for profiles to easily identify them
   - Regularly clean up unused profiles

2. **Resource Usage**:
   - Close tabs when not in use to conserve memory
   - Avoid opening too many tabs in a single profile
   - Close browser profiles when finished to free up resources

3. **Security**:
   - Use unique fingerprints for different activities
   - Enable proxies for sensitive operations
   - Avoid logging into multiple accounts in the same profile

4. **Performance**:
   - Clear browser cache periodically
   - Restart profiles if performance degrades
   - Update fingerprints regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Won't Launch**:
   - Check if the browser service is running
   - Verify that you haven't reached the maximum number of profiles
   - Check for network connectivity issues

2. **Slow Performance**:
   - Close unused tabs and profiles
   - Check system resources (CPU, memory)
   - Verify proxy connection if using one

3. **Fingerprint Detection**:
   - Update to a more unique fingerprint
   - Try a different browser type or platform
   - Use a proxy from a different location

4. **Connection Issues**:
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify proxy settings if applicable
   - Ensure the browser service is running

## Technical Details

The Swarm browser uses the following technologies:

- **CamouFox Engine**: For fingerprint spoofing and browser emulation
- **React**: For the user interface
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication with the browser service
- **IndexedDB**: For local storage of browser profiles and settings

## Security Considerations

The Swarm browser implements several security measures:

1. **Sandboxed Iframes**: All web content is loaded in sandboxed iframes
2. **Domain Restrictions**: Certain domains can be blocked for security
3. **Secure Connections**: HTTPS is enforced for all connections
4. **Isolated Sessions**: Each profile has its own isolated browsing session
5. **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted in storage
