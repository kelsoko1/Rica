Instead, please report them via email to: [security@yourdomain.com]

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the progress of addressing the vulnerability
- Credit in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Notification when the vulnerability is fixed

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all services
   - Rotate API keys and secrets regularly
   - Use `.env.example` as a template, not `.env` directly

2. **Docker Security**
   - Keep Docker and Docker Compose up to date
   - Regularly update container images
   - Use specific image versions, not `latest`
   - Review and limit container permissions

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Configure firewall rules appropriately
   - Limit exposed ports to only what's necessary
   - Use VPN or SSH tunnels for remote access

4. **Access Control**
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
   - Enable two-factor authentication where available
   - Regularly review and revoke unused access
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

5. **Data Protection**
   - Regularly backup your data
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Securely delete data when no longer needed
   - Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Use secure session management

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Review security advisories for dependencies
   - Use lock files to ensure consistent versions

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Never hardcode secrets in code
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Use secret management tools in production
   - Rotate secrets regularly

4. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use API keys for authentication
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper CORS policies

5. **Docker Security**
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Limit container capabilities
   - Use read-only file systems where possible

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

Rica Platform includes the following security features:

1. **HTTP Security Headers**
   - Implemented via Helmet middleware
   - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevents brute force attacks
   - Configurable per endpoint

3. **Input Validation**
   - All API endpoints validate inputs
   - Prevents injection attacks

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - Properly configured for cross-origin requests
   - Restricts access to trusted origins

5. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Secure session management
   - Role-based access control

6. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Structured logging with Winston
   - Health checks for all services
   - Error tracking and reporting

### Security Configurations

#### Nginx Security Headers

```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
```

#### Docker Security

- Non-root users in containers
- Read-only root filesystems where possible
- Limited container capabilities
- Health checks for all services

#### Environment Variables

All sensitive configuration is managed via environment variables:
- API keys
- Database passwords
- Encryption keys
- JWT secrets
